Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis of TransJakarta Tap-In/Tap-Out Data

This project focuses on cleaning, structuring, and preparing TransJakarta trip data for analysis. Using tap-in/tap-out records across stops and corridors, I addressed inconsistencies, handled missing values, and created analysis-ready tables to support insights on demand patterns, corridor performance, and passenger behavior. Spatial context is referenced where useful but not the primary focus. The structured dataset also forms a foundation for future multimodal integration studies
