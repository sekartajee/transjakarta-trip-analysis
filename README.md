# TransJakarta-Ridership-Exploratory-Analysis
Exploratory data analysis of TransJakarta bus ridership patterns based on transactional trip data. This project focuses on understanding passenger characteristics, travel behaviour, and network usage using SQL for analysis and Power BI for visualisation.

Data source: [Transjakarta - Public Transportation Transaction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dikisahkan/transjakarta-transportation-transaction)

## Contents
- **Data:** Cleaned and processed datasets used in the analysis  
- **Scripts:** SQL queries for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis  
- **Visualisations:** Power BI dashboards illustrating ridership patterns and key insights  

## Key Insights
- Ridership is dominated by **young and working-age passengers**, with a slight female majority.  
- Demand is driven by **weekday commuting**, with consistent morning and evening peak hours.  
- A small number of **stops and corridors account for a large share of trips**, indicating concentrated network usage.  
- **Evening peak trips are longer** than morning trips, suggesting differences in travel conditions or behaviour.
